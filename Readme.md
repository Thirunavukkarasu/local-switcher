# Localhost Switcher Chrome Extension

Localhost Switcher is a simple Chrome extension that allows developers to quickly switch between different localhost environments. It is built using React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and the CRXJS Vite plugin for Chrome extension development.

## Features

- Switch between different predefined localhost environments.
- Add custom URLs for localhost environments.
- Quick access to commonly used development URLs directly from the Chrome extension.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling the extension popup.
- **CRXJS Vite Plugin**: For easy Chrome extension development with Vite.
- **Vite**: For fast bundling and development.
- **Chrome Storage API**: For persisting the list of URLs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thirunavukkarasu/localhost-switcher.git
   cd localhost-switcher
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
   npm install
```

3. Run the extension in development mode:

```bash
   npm run dev
```
This command will serve the extension locally and create the necessary files in the dist/ folder.

4. Load the extension in Chrome:

- Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
- Enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the top right.
- Click the Load unpacked button and select the dist/ folder generated by the Vite build.

5. Build for production:

```bash
   npm run build
```

The final build will be generated in the `dist/` folder, which you can then load into Chrome as an unpacked extension.

## Usage

1. **Click on the Localhost Switcher icon** in the Chrome toolbar.
2. **Select one of the predefined localhost URLs** (such as `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:8080`, etc.) to quickly switch to that environment.
3. **Add custom URLs**:
    * Type a custom URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4000`) into the input field and click the **Add URL** button.
    * The custom URL will be saved for future use and displayed in the popup.

* src/components/Popup.tsx: The main React component that provides the UI for switching between localhost environments.
* manifest.config.ts: This file defines the Chrome extension manifest, including permissions and popup settings.
* vite.config.ts: Configures Vite and CRXJS for building the Chrome extension.

## Available Scripts

* npm run dev: Starts the development server and watches for file changes.
* npm run build: Builds the extension for production.
* npm run lint: Runs ESLint to check for issues in your TypeScript code.
